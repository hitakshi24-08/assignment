**Recursive Spectral Modularity Partitioning of Zachary's Karate Club**

_This repository contains a complete, runnable Jupyter Notebook that fulfills all tasks for the DSC212 Graph Theory project. The notebook implements the recursive spectral modularity algorithm from scratch to find and analyze the community structure of the famous Zachary's Karate Club graph._


**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
The Zachary’s Karate Club graph is a classic social network dataset representing the friendships among 34 members of a university karate club in the 1970s. The club eventually split into two factions after a conflict between the instructor (Node 0, “Mr. Hi”) and the administrator (Node 33, “John A.”).

In this project, I analyzed the network to understand whether mathematical and graph-theoretic algorithms can reveal the hidden tension that eventually caused the real-life split.
