**Recursive Spectral Modularity Partitioning of Zachary's Karate Club**

_This repository contains a complete, runnable Jupyter Notebook that fulfills all tasks for the DSC212 Graph Theory project. The notebook implements the recursive spectral modularity algorithm from scratch to find and analyze the community structure of the famous Zachary's Karate Club graph._


**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
_The Zachary’s Karate Club graph is a well-known network dataset that maps the friendships among 34 members of a university karate club in the 1970s. It became famous because the club later split into two groups after a disagreement between the instructor (Node 0, “Mr. Hi”) and the administrator (Node 33, “John A.”).
This project uses those friendship connections — recorded before the split — to explore one main idea: Can a mathematical algorithm, using only the network structure, detect the hidden tensions that eventually caused the real-life division?_
